# Self Evaluation for Enigma 2008
## Kevin Cuadros

 ### Functionality
  - For functionality in my project I was able to reach cracking method and command line interface

### Object Oriented Programming
  - For OOP I was able implement 1 module where there are  methods that two classes share. The
    module I made is called shiftable. Where all my offsets and keys are combined to make my shifts.
    I broke down my project in four classes: Encryption, Decryption, Cracking, and Enigma.

### Ruby Coventions
  - For ruby convention I was able to make classes that made sense and used correct syntax and indentation. Most enumerables that I chose made sense on why I used them. The only time I used a hash is when I created
  one for encrypt, decrypt, and crack. I used arrays because I found it to make more sense to use.

### Test Driven Development
  - For TDD I was able to use stubs. The stubs I used were for date generator and key generator since
    they both resulted in randomness everytime I tested. I also tested obvious edge caseses like capitaliziation and the implementaion of special characters or with and without date or keys. My test coverage result is 100% with 414/414 lines covered.


### Version Control
  - For version control I was able to make 89 commits which is far more enough than the required.
    I also made 10 pull requests which was a lot more than the required. I organized my project in 5 different parts : Encryption, Decryption, Cracking, Enigma and Command Line Interface. Each part represents a class or a step working towards the interaction pattern. This helped me keep in line of how I wanted to approach this project in the correct manner.
